## EpicNoir
Based on original [EpicNoir](https://github.com/c64-dev/es-theme-epicnoir) theme by [c64-dev](https://github.com/c64-dev)

### Changes
- Replaced broken system carousel with vertical wheel with system logos.
- Add distinct backgrounds & controllers for each system. No repetition or placeholder backgrounds anymore.
- Cleaner background for all gamelist views with minimal elements and a better color scheme.
- Replaced metadata in detailed view with what I consider as more useful info for a player.
- Added theme for clock in all views
- Update menu and other color schemes to match that of 351Noir.

## 351Noir
Customised version of EpicNoir Theme for Anbernic's RG351p handheld running AmberElec firmware.

Based on [Amberelec-351Noir](https://github.com/SzalikDesigns/amberelec-351noir) by [Szalik](https://github.com/SzalikDesigns) and [kulvind3r](https://github.com/kulvind3r)

### Changes
None other than reduced system count and a small bug fix for grid gamelist view

I personally worked on Amberelec-351Noir so this fork is pretty much identical to the original. Just keeping it here in case i want to change something for my own need, like the reduced systems count to reduce theme size.
